<br><br>
Alternate Advancement is a way to gain abilities for your character that are outside of level advancement. You can assign some of the experience your character gains into Alternate Advancement and apply the points gained that way to Alternate Advancement abilities (commonly referred to as AAs). You can start earning these AAs as early as level 1.
<br><br>
To open the Alternate Advancement window, hit [ V ] or open your Inventory [ I ] and click the Alt. Adv. button on the bottom left of the Inventory window.
<br><br>
Across the top of the window you will see several tabs. Each tab contains a list of Alternate Advancement abilities (AAs). Click on them to learn what they can do for your character. Pay special attention to the requirements listed.
<br><br>
At the top right of the window you will see Exp to AA. This is where you can choose how much of your character's experience points will be used to gain AA points instead of level gain. As you fill the AA exp bar you will gain AA Points that you can spend on AA abilities. Experience gain levels 1-50 is lower per kill based on enemy con, than at level 50 and higher.
<br><br>
Once you have enough AA points to learn an Alternate Advancement ability, just click on the ability you want to learn, and then click the Train button on the right of the window. Many AA abilities are always active, and purchasing it is all you need to do. Some, however, need to be activated. These can be used by selecting the AA ability, then clicking the Hotkey button under the Train button. This will create a Hotbutton that you can place on a Hotbutton bar and click whenever you need to use the AA ability.
