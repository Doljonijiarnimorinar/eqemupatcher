Unfortunately, you have just died.  The good news is that if your character is level 10 or under you have revived with no experience loss.
<br><br>
This will not be the case after you reach 11th level.  At that time you will being to lose a small amount of experience as a result of dying, and you can have your body resurrected to restore some of that lost experience.
<br><br>
If your character is high enough level to leave a corpse, it will remain in the game for 24 hours.  After that time it will "decay" and disappear from the world.

- <c "#66CCFF">To help you find your corpse</c>, if you have time, type /loc to get your location before you die.
<br>
- <c "#66CCFF">To help you find your corpse</c>, Bards, Necromancer and Shadowknights have spells that locate and even summon corpses.  It's a good idea to offer a reward for such services, even if you have to get that reward off your corpse.
