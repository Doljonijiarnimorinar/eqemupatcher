<br><br>
There may be times during play where you find yourself in need of some help, whether it comes in the form of information, assistance, or the occasional divine intervention. During these times, your best bet is to turn to The Heroes' Journey (THJ) Guides.
<br><br>
Guides are not there to help you if you become lost, to resurrect your character if you die, or to provide any sort of special favors. The purpose of the Guides is to make sure that everyone playing has an enjoyable experience without the hindrance of unforeseen problems.
<br><br>
To seek help, join the THJ Discord and inquire in the #General chat channel.
<br><br>
For more information about contacting us for help, reach out in the THJ official Discord.
<br><br>
Since thousands of players may be online at the same time, Guides may be swamped responding to other players' requests. However, THJ has a passionate dedicated and knowledgeable group of players, if a Guide isn't able to help you right away, there are many in Discord that likely can.
<br><br>
When you are contacted, explain your situation. The Guide will ask for more information if necessary. You can help the Guide by conducting yourself in a calm, rational manner and by editing your problem down to the relevant details. Be patient and your problems will be solved if they fall within the rules of the game.
