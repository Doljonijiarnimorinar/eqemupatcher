<br><br>
If you are having technical problems with the game, (Lockups, Connection Issues, etc.), a Guide will be unable to assist you. They can, however, help direct you to the right place. For game issues best described as a 'bug', there is a #Bug forum within the official THJ Discord server where you can submit a report. For connectivity issues, or other concerns external to the game, or if you're unsure of what the issue is related to, there is a #Support-Forum where those issues can be submitted more generally.
