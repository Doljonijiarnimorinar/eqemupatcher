<c "#ffff00"> 3.12 The Bazaar </c>
<br><br>
The Bazaar is a central hub within The Heroes' Journey (THJ). This zone contains key progression NPCs, GMs, vendors, specialized merchants and service NPCs, and it's where players can set up a trader to sell their goods in an automated way to other players. Each player is autogranted the travel skill 'Bazaar and Back' via their Alternate Advancement window, on the General Tab. This travel skill will allow you to travel to the Bazaar from anywhere in the world. Then, if clicked again, the skill will return the player back to that same spot they originally traveled from.

<c "#66CCFF">Key Vendors and NPCs</c>
<br>
1. A Faded Memory is part of a player's first steps in THJ, this quest NPC looks like a ghostly figure and stands next to the western-most bank.
2. Tearel in the bazaar can be used to teleport to various destinations throughout the THJ world. You unlock them account wide by visiting stone circles within key areas of the world. To utilize Tearel's travel options, hail him and attune the Magic Map to the location by following the appropriate prompts in his text dialog. Once attuned, clicking the floating Magic Map on the desk in front of Tearel will instantly port you to the location selected.
3. Donation Merchant is a vendor that allows you to purchase donator items like large bags for Echo of Memory (EOM) - an in-game currency awarded for server donations. Similarly, the Donation Server Buff Merchant allows you to trade EOM for server-wide buffs which benefit all players on the server.
4. The Polymorphist in the Bazaar now offers race and gender changes (eventually they will offer name and pet name changes as well).
5. A Mischievous Halfling runs the casino of THJ, hand him 5000 platinum pieces (pp) or 2 EOM and you will have a chance at winning some useful items.
6. A Perveyor of Glamour will take 5000pp and an item you have, and turn it into a Glamour-Stone. A Glamour-Stone can be used as a weapon ornamentation, and it will change the look of your weapon. Additionally, you can offer her EOM for a chance at a random Glamour-Stone. This pulls from all a selected list of weapons and shields in the database, and while this can be anything from a Rusty Dagger, to an Epic, it is structured to have a high chance at something unique.
7. In addition you will find key NPCs like the Guildmasters (GM) needed to select your initial classes. When you log into the game with your initial class, you simply need to hail and follow the text prompts of the GM for the classes you'd like to add to your initial.

<c "#66CCFF">Browsing and Buying from Player Traders</c>
<br>
To find what you want in the Bazaar from those players who have setup a trader, type /bazaar. This opens the Bazaar Search Window. On the left you will see a place to type in the name or partial name of the item you are looking for. Beneath that are several selection options to help you narrow down your search.
<br><br>
When you find an item you're interested in, you can either go to the trader directly by looking for them under covered stalls in the Bazaar, or you can use the 'Buy' button to the right hand side of the item you'd like to purchase, and for an additional fee this will be delivered instantly to the Parcel vendor, stationed next to the bankers. If you opt to trade in-persin, once you find the merchant, just right-click him or her to open their merchant window and buy what you want!
<br><br>
<c "#66CCFF">Becoming a Merchant</c>
<br>
To become a merchant you will need to purchase one or more Trader's Satchel from Bag Merchant in the bazaar. Any item you wish to sell will have to be placed in a Trader's Satchel. Place the items you want to sell into the satchel, move your character to one of the covered wooden bazaar platforms. Then type /trader to open the Bazaar Vendor window.
<br><br>
Use the Set Price button to set the prices for your items. Even for stacked items, you are setting the price for ONE of those items. Once you have all of your prices set, click the Begin Trader button and you will become a merchant.
<br><br>
<c "#66CCFF">** NOTE: </c> When starting out it is probably best to sell small, cheap items until you get used to the system.  You should also note that Trader's Satchels are very heavy and you should be sure to leave them in your bank before leaving the Bazaar zone.
