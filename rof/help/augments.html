<c "#ffff00"> 3.6 Augmentations </c>
<br><br>
Augmentations are special items that you can embed in weapons or armor to make them more powerful. You can recognize such items by looking for the Augmentation tag in the item information window (right-click and hold on the item). You should also take note of the slot types that the augment fits into (shown at the bottom of the item description window).
<br><br>
<c "#66CCFF">** NOTE: </c>Restrictions on the augment and the item will be additive when you embed the augment. So if you embed an augment that requires that the character be a Troll into an item that requires the character be level 30, then the augmented item will require a Troll of at least level 30.
<br><br>
In order to embed an augment into another item, you will need to make sure that the item has the slot type indicated in the augment. If it does, then all you have to do to augment your item is to click the augment so that it's on your cursor, and then with the augment on your cursor, click the augment slot you'd like to add it to (which will be highlighted in yellow if the slot is compatible with the augment on your cursor).
<br><br>
<c "#66CCFF"> Removing Augmentations: </c>To remove an augmentation from an item, you must use an augmentation distiller which can be purchased from the Augmentation Vendor in the Bazaar.
<br><br>
Note that some augmentations can be removed without an augmentation distiller, these are called Glamour-Stones and can be added and removed simply by clicking them into and out of the augmentation slot with your mouse.
